What is Threading in Java?
Threading in Java is a way to achieve concurrent execution of code. A thread is the smallest unit of a process that can run independently, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously in the same program.

Java's threading model is based on the Thread class and the Runnable interface, which are part of the java.lang package.

Why Use Threads?
Threads are used for:

Parallelism: Executing multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., downloading a file while processing user input).
Efficiency: Utilizing CPU cores effectively for better performance.
Asynchronous tasks: Running background tasks without blocking the main thread (e.g., GUI applications or web servers).
Basic Example: Single Thread
In Java, a program starts with the main thread. Here is an example of single-threaded execution:

java
Copy code
public class SingleThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Start of Main Thread");

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Printing: " + i);
        }

        System.out.println("End of Main Thread");
    }
}
Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Start of Main Thread
Printing: 1
Printing: 2
Printing: 3
Printing: 4
Printing: 5
End of Main Thread
This program runs sequentially, with only one thread (the main thread).

Creating and Running Threads
1. Using the Thread Class
You can create a thread by extending the Thread class and overriding its run() method:

java
Copy code
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Pauses the thread for 500 ms
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start(); // Starts the new thread

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main: " + i);
        }
    }
}
Output (may vary):

makefile
Copy code
Main: 1
Thread: 1
Main: 2
Thread: 2
Main: 3
Thread: 3
Main: 4
Thread: 4
Main: 5
Thread: 5
Here, the thread.start() creates a separate thread that runs concurrently with the main thread.

2. Using the Runnable Interface
Instead of extending the Thread class, you can implement the Runnable interface.

java
Copy code
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Runnable Thread: " + i);
        }
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start();

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Main: " + i);
        }
    }
}
Using Runnable is preferred when you need to extend another class (since Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance).

Advanced Concepts
1. Thread Synchronization
When multiple threads access shared resources, race conditions may occur. Use synchronized blocks or methods to avoid this.

java
Copy code
class SharedResource {
    synchronized void printNumbers(int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println(n * i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(400);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }
}

class MySyncThread extends Thread {
    SharedResource resource;

    MySyncThread(SharedResource resource) {
        this.resource = resource;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        resource.printNumbers(5);
    }
}

public class SynchronizationExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SharedResource resource = new SharedResource();

        MySyncThread t1 = new MySyncThread(resource);
        MySyncThread t2 = new MySyncThread(resource);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
Output (with synchronization):

Copy code
5
10
15
20
25
5
10
15
20
25
Without synchronization, threads might overlap their outputs.

2. Thread Pooling
Creating and managing threads can be resource-intensive. Instead, Java provides Executors to manage thread pools.

java
Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        Runnable task1 = () -> System.out.println("Task 1 by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Runnable task2 = () -> System.out.println("Task 2 by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Runnable task3 = () -> System.out.println("Task 3 by " + Thread.currentThread().getName());

        executor.execute(task1);
        executor.execute(task2);
        executor.execute(task3);

        executor.shutdown(); // Shutdown the thread pool
    }
}
Output:

arduino
Copy code
Task 1 by pool-1-thread-1
Task 2 by pool-1-thread-2
Task 3 by pool-1-thread-3
3. Callable and Future
If you want a thread to return a result, use Callable and Future.

java
Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.Callable;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class CallableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                sum += i;
            }
            return sum;
        };

        Future<Integer> result = executor.submit(task);

        try {
            System.out.println("Result: " + result.get()); // Blocks until the result is available
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
Output:

makefile
Copy code
Result: 15
4. Deadlocks
A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources.

java
Copy code
class DeadlockExample {
    static final Object lock1 = new Object();
    static final Object lock2 = new Object();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock1) {
                System.out.println("Thread 1: Locked lock1");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}

                synchronized (lock2) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1: Locked lock2");
                }
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (lock2) {
                System.out.println("Thread 2: Locked lock2");
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}

                synchronized (lock1) {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2: Locked lock1");
                }
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
This program demonstrates a deadlock. Avoid such issues using proper design, like acquiring locks in the same order.

Conclusion
Java threading allows you to create efficient, concurrent applications. Start with simple threads, then progress to advanced features like synchronization, thread pools, Callable, and avoiding deadlocks. Proper use of threading can significantly improve application performance and responsiveness.

Difference Between Threading and Multithreading
Aspect	Threading	Multithreading
Definition	The basic concept of executing a single thread (or unit of execution) in a program.	Extending the concept to allow multiple threads to run concurrently within the same process.
Execution	Only one thread executes at a time (apart from the main thread).	Multiple threads run simultaneously, sharing the same memory space.
Complexity	Easier to implement since it involves fewer threads.	More complex to manage due to synchronization, communication, and thread scheduling.
Efficiency	Limited parallelism and may not fully utilize multi-core CPUs.	Exploits multi-core CPUs for higher efficiency and better performance through true parallelism.
Use Case	Suitable for small tasks where concurrency isn't a priority.	Best for tasks requiring concurrent execution, like handling multiple clients or background tasks.
Threads in Client-Server Architecture
In a client-server architecture, threads allow the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking or sequential processing. Here's how it works:

1. Single-Threaded Server
In a single-threaded server, the server handles one client at a time. While handling one client, other clients must wait, which can lead to delays.

java
Copy code
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

public class SingleThreadedServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);
        System.out.println("Server started on port 1234");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); // Accept one client
            System.out.println("Connected to client");
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

            String message = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Client says: " + message);
            out.println("Hello, client!");
            clientSocket.close(); // Close after handling
        }
    }
}
Limitations:

Only one client can be served at a time.
Others must wait until the current client is handled.
2. Multi-Threaded Server
A multi-threaded server creates a new thread for each connected client, allowing multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously.

java
Copy code
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;

class ClientHandler extends Thread {
    private Socket clientSocket;

    public ClientHandler(Socket socket) {
        this.clientSocket = socket;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

            String message = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Client says: " + message);
            out.println("Hello from server!");
            clientSocket.close(); // Close after responding
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class MultiThreadedServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);
        System.out.println("Multi-threaded server started on port 1234");

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept(); // Accept a client connection
            System.out.println("Connected to client");
            new ClientHandler(clientSocket).start(); // Create a new thread for the client
        }
    }
}
Advantages:

Each client is handled in a separate thread.
The server can handle multiple clients concurrently.
Choosing Between Threading and Multithreading
1. When to Use Threading
The program is simple and only handles one task at a time.
Sequential processing is sufficient (e.g., processing one client at a time).
Resource constraints make creating multiple threads inefficient.
2. When to Use Multithreading
The program must handle multiple tasks or multiple clients simultaneously (e.g., chat servers, game servers).
Performance improvement is desired by utilizing multiple CPU cores.
Tasks can run independently without interfering with each other.
Scaling Multi-Threaded Client-Server Architecture
For larger systems, multithreading can be extended with thread pooling to limit the number of threads created and improve efficiency.

Thread Pool Example for Server
java
Copy code
import java.io.*;
import java.net.*;
import java.util.concurrent.*;

class PooledClientHandler implements Runnable {
    private Socket clientSocket;

    public PooledClientHandler(Socket socket) {
        this.clientSocket = socket;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream(), true);

            String message = in.readLine();
            System.out.println("Client says: " + message);
            out.println("Hello from server (pooled)!");
            clientSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadPoolServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(1234);
        System.out.println("Thread pool server started on port 1234");

        ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10); // Pool of 10 threads

        while (true) {
            Socket clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
            System.out.println("Connected to client");
            threadPool.execute(new PooledClientHandler(clientSocket));
        }
    }
}
Advantages of Thread Pooling:

Limits the number of threads created, saving resources.
Handles large numbers of clients efficiently.
Reuses threads for handling new tasks.
Conclusion
Threading is sufficient for small-scale applications where tasks can be handled sequentially.
Multithreading is essential for high-performance, concurrent applications like servers handling multiple clients.
Use thread pooling to manage resources efficiently for systems with a large number of clients. This approach balances performance with scalability and prevents overloading the server with excessive threads.

Give a example in which multiple functions are happening each by different thread

Here’s an example of a Java program that demonstrates multiple threads performing different functions simultaneously. Each thread is assigned a unique task, such as printing numbers, reversing a string, and calculating the sum of an array.

Code Example: Multi-Functionality Using Threads
java
Copy code
class PrintNumbers extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread 1: Printing numbers from 1 to 10:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Pause for 500ms to simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Thread 1: Finished printing numbers.");
    }
}

class ReverseString extends Thread {
    private String str;

    public ReverseString(String str) {
        this.str = str;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("\nThread 2: Reversing the string \"" + str + "\"");
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse();
        System.out.println("Thread 2: Reversed string: " + reversed);
    }
}

class ArraySum extends Thread {
    private int[] numbers;

    public ArraySum(int[] numbers) {
        this.numbers = numbers;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("\nThread 3: Calculating the sum of the array");
        int sum = 0;
        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number;
            try {
                Thread.sleep(300); // Simulate work
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Thread 3: Sum of the array is: " + sum);
    }
}

public class MultiThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create and start threads for different functions
        PrintNumbers thread1 = new PrintNumbers();
        ReverseString thread2 = new ReverseString("Multithreading");
        ArraySum thread3 = new ArraySum(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});

        thread1.start(); // Start Thread 1
        thread2.start(); // Start Thread 2
        thread3.start(); // Start Thread 3

        // Wait for threads to finish before exiting the main method
        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
            thread3.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("\nAll threads have completed their tasks.");
    }
}
Explanation of the Code
Thread 1 (PrintNumbers):
Prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a delay of 500 milliseconds between each number.

Thread 2 (ReverseString):
Reverses a string ("Multithreading") and prints the result.

Thread 3 (ArraySum):
Calculates the sum of an array ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}) while simulating a delay of 300 milliseconds for each number.

Output
The threads execute concurrently, so the order of output may vary, but you'll see results from all threads interleaved:

mathematica
Copy code
Thread 1: Printing numbers from 1 to 10:
1

Thread 2: Reversing the string "Multithreading"
Thread 2: Reversed string: gnidaerhtitluM

Thread 3: Calculating the sum of the array
2
Thread 1: 3
Thread 3: 4
Thread 3: 5
Thread 3: 6
Thread 3: Sum of the array is: 15
Thread 1: Finished printing numbers.

All threads have completed their tasks.
Key Concepts in the Example
Thread Class: Each task is implemented by extending the Thread class.
start() Method: Begins the execution of a thread.
run() Method: Contains the task logic for each thread.
join() Method: Ensures the main thread waits until all threads have completed.
This demonstrates how multiple threads can perform different tasks concurrently, enabling parallelism and improving the efficiency of programs that handle independent or time-consuming tasks.

You said:
what if there is a single class and all the functions are in that?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If all the functions are in a single class, you can create multiple threads and assign each thread to execute a specific function of that class using Runnable or directly invoking the methods of the same instance.

Here’s an example where all the functions reside in a single class, and each thread performs one function:

Code Example: Single Class with Multiple Functions
java
Copy code
class MultiTask implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;

    // Constructor to assign a specific task name to each thread
    public MultiTask(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        switch (taskName) {
            case "printNumbers":
                printNumbers();
                break;
            case "reverseString":
                reverseString("Multithreading");
                break;
            case "calculateSum":
                calculateSum(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5});
                break;
            default:
                System.out.println("Invalid task!");
        }
    }

    // Function 1: Prints numbers from 1 to 10
    public void printNumbers() {
        System.out.println("Thread: Printing numbers from 1 to 10:");
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(500); // Simulate delay
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Thread: Finished printing numbers.");
    }

    // Function 2: Reverses a given string
    public void reverseString(String str) {
        System.out.println("\nThread: Reversing the string \"" + str + "\"");
        StringBuilder reversed = new StringBuilder(str).reverse();
        System.out.println("Thread: Reversed string: " + reversed);
    }

    // Function 3: Calculates the sum of an array
    public void calculateSum(int[] numbers) {
        System.out.println("\nThread: Calculating the sum of the array");
        int sum = 0;
        for (int number : numbers) {
            sum += number;
            try {
                Thread.sleep(300); // Simulate delay
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Thread: Sum of the array is: " + sum);
    }
}

public class SingleClassMultiFunctions {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create threads for different tasks
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new MultiTask("printNumbers"));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new MultiTask("reverseString"));
        Thread thread3 = new Thread(new MultiTask("calculateSum"));

        // Start threads
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
        thread3.start();

        // Wait for threads to complete
        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
            thread3.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("\nAll threads have completed their tasks.");
    }
}
Explanation of the Code
Single Class for All Functions:

All three functions (printNumbers, reverseString, calculateSum) are defined within the MultiTask class.
Runnable Interface:

The Runnable interface is implemented to allow the same instance of the class to perform tasks in different threads.
Task Switching Using switch:

Each thread receives a task name (printNumbers, reverseString, or calculateSum) during creation, and the run() method invokes the appropriate function.
Thread Execution:

Each thread runs its respective function, allowing concurrent execution.
Output
The output will be interleaved, as threads run concurrently. It will look something like this:

vbnet
Copy code
Thread: Printing numbers from 1 to 10:
1
Thread: Reversing the string "Multithreading"
Thread: Reversed string: gnidaerhtitluM

Thread: Calculating the sum of the array
2
3
Thread: 4
Thread: 5
Thread: 6
Thread: Sum of the array is: 15
Thread: Finished printing numbers.

All threads have completed their tasks.
Key Advantages of This Approach
Single Class Design: All functionality is encapsulated within one class for simplicity.
Reusable Threads: Multiple threads can call different methods of the same class instance.
Concurrent Execution: Functions execute concurrently, utilizing CPU cores effectively.
This approach is helpful in scenarios where all logic needs to reside in a single class but requires multiple threads for parallel execution of its methods.

Thread pooling is a mechanism to efficiently manage and reuse threads in Java. Instead of creating new threads every time a task needs to be executed, a thread pool maintains a fixed number of threads that are reused for executing tasks. This approach avoids the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly, especially in high-concurrency situations, such as web servers or large-scale applications.

How Thread Pooling Works
Thread Pool Creation: A thread pool is created with a fixed or dynamic number of threads (workers).

Task Submission: Tasks are submitted to the thread pool. Each task implements the Runnable or Callable interface.

Thread Assignment:

When a task is submitted, it is placed in a task queue.
If an idle thread is available, it picks up the task and starts executing.
If no threads are available, the task waits in the queue until a thread becomes free.
Thread Reuse: Once a thread completes its task, it becomes available for new tasks, instead of being destroyed.

Efficiency: This approach reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly, leading to better performance, especially in multi-tasking applications.

When to Use Thread Pooling
Thread pooling is ideal for:

Applications that need to handle a large number of short-lived tasks.
Scenarios where the cost of thread creation and destruction is significant.
Systems where task execution needs to be controlled to avoid excessive resource usage.
Thread Pool in Java
Java provides built-in support for thread pooling in the java.util.concurrent package via the Executor framework. The most commonly used class is Executors, which provides factory methods to create thread pools.

Example: Thread Pool in Action
This example demonstrates the creation of a thread pool and its use to handle multiple tasks.

java
Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

class Task implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;

    public Task(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is executing task: " + taskName);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work by sleeping for 2 seconds
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has finished task: " + taskName);
    }
}

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Step 2: Submit multiple tasks to the thread pool
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            Task task = new Task("Task " + i);
            threadPool.submit(task);
        }

        // Step 3: Shut down the thread pool
        threadPool.shutdown(); // No new tasks can be submitted
    }
}
Explanation of the Code
Thread Pool Creation:

Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3) creates a thread pool with 3 threads.
Task Submission:

The for loop submits 6 tasks to the pool.
Since the pool has only 3 threads, only 3 tasks will execute concurrently. The rest will wait in the queue until a thread becomes free.
Task Execution:

Each task runs in a separate thread and prints its progress.
Thread Pool Shutdown:

threadPool.shutdown() ensures no new tasks can be submitted, but existing tasks will continue to run.
Sample Output

Copy code
pool-1-thread-1 is executing task: Task 1
pool-1-thread-2 is executing task: Task 2
pool-1-thread-3 is executing task: Task 3
pool-1-thread-1 has finished task: Task 1
pool-1-thread-2 has finished task: Task 2
pool-1-thread-3 has finished task: Task 3
pool-1-thread-1 is executing task: Task 4
pool-1-thread-2 is executing task: Task 5
pool-1-thread-3 is executing task: Task 6
pool-1-thread-1 has finished task: Task 4
pool-1-thread-2 has finished task: Task 5
pool-1-thread-3 has finished task: Task 6
Here:

Threads are reused: Only three threads are created (pool-1-thread-1, pool-1-thread-2, pool-1-thread-3) even though there are six tasks.
Tasks are executed in batches of 3 due to the pool size.
Types of Thread Pools
Fixed Thread Pool:

A pool with a fixed number of threads.
Created using Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads).
Cached Thread Pool:

A pool with dynamically changing threads, suitable for short-lived tasks.
Created using Executors.newCachedThreadPool().
Single Thread Pool:

A pool with only one thread, ensuring tasks are executed sequentially.
Created using Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().
Scheduled Thread Pool:

A pool for tasks that need to run at fixed intervals or after delays.
Created using Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(int nThreads).
Choosing Thread Pool Size
Too Few Threads: Tasks may take longer to execute, underutilizing CPU.
Too Many Threads: Excessive context switching may reduce performance.
You should calculate the optimal thread pool size based on:

Number of CPU cores: For CPU-intensive tasks, pool size ≈ number of cores.
Task type: For I/O-bound tasks, you may need more threads to keep the CPU busy while waiting for I/O.
Why Use Thread Pools?
Performance: Reuses threads, reducing creation/destruction overhead.
Resource Management: Limits the number of active threads to avoid excessive memory/CPU usage.
Scalability: Handles a large number of tasks efficiently.
Thread pooling is essential for building scalable, high-performance systems, especially for server-client applications, web services, and real-time systems.

Let’s dive deeper into thread pooling and explain it step-by-step in simple terms, with easy-to-understand examples.

What is Thread Pooling?
Thread pooling is like a team of workers (threads) who are always ready to do tasks. Instead of hiring a new worker (creating a new thread) every time a task needs to be done, you keep a pool of workers (threads) who can take tasks from a queue, complete them, and wait for the next task.

Why Use Thread Pooling?
Efficient Resource Management: Creating and destroying threads repeatedly is expensive. A thread pool reuses existing threads, avoiding this overhead.

Avoid Overloading: If a program creates too many threads, it can slow down the system or crash it. A thread pool limits the number of active threads.

Faster Execution: Reusing threads means tasks are executed faster since there’s no need to create threads for every new task.

Step-by-Step Example
1. Imagine a Pizza Shop
A pizza shop has 5 chefs (threads in a pool).
Customers keep arriving and placing orders (tasks).
If there are more than 5 orders at a time, some orders must wait in a queue.
When a chef finishes making one pizza, they pick up the next order from the queue.
Similarly, in thread pooling:

Threads = Chefs
Tasks = Orders
Thread Pool = Group of chefs
Task Queue = Waiting orders
Thread Pooling in Java
Java provides thread pooling with the Executor framework in the java.util.concurrent package. Let’s build this step by step.

Basic Thread Pool Example
In this example, we’ll create a thread pool with 3 threads to process multiple tasks.

java
Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

// Task Class
class Task implements Runnable {
    private String taskName;

    public Task(String taskName) {
        this.taskName = taskName;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is performing: " + taskName);
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulate time-consuming work
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has completed: " + taskName);
    }
}

public class ThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a thread pool with 3 threads
        ExecutorService threadPool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);

        // Step 2: Submit multiple tasks to the thread pool
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
            Task task = new Task("Task " + i);
            threadPool.submit(task);
        }

        // Step 3: Shut down the thread pool
        threadPool.shutdown();
    }
}
Explanation of Code
Thread Pool Creation:

Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3) creates a thread pool with 3 threads.
Only 3 threads will run at any given time.
Task Submission:

Six tasks are submitted to the pool.
Since there are only 3 threads, the first 3 tasks start immediately, while the rest wait in the queue.
Thread Reuse:

When one thread finishes its task, it picks up the next task from the queue.
Shutdown:

threadPool.shutdown() ensures no new tasks can be submitted, but existing tasks will complete.

pool-1-thread-1 is performing: Task 1
pool-1-thread-2 is performing: Task 2
pool-1-thread-3 is performing: Task 3
pool-1-thread-1 has completed: Task 1
pool-1-thread-2 has completed: Task 2
pool-1-thread-3 has completed: Task 3

pool-1-thread-3 is performing: Task 6
pool-1-thread-1 has completed: Task 4
pool-1-thread-2 has completed: Task 5
pool-1-thread-3 has completed: Task 6
Here, three threads (pool-1-thread-1, pool-1-thread-2, pool-1-thread-3) handle all six tasks.

Advanced Thread Pool Example: Cached Thread Pool
A cached thread pool creates threads as needed and reuses idle threads. It’s suitable for handling many short-lived tasks.

java
Copy code
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class CachedThreadPoolExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Step 1: Create a cached thread pool
        ExecutorService cachedThreadPool = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();

        // Step 2: Submit tasks to the pool
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            final int taskId = i;
            cachedThreadPool.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is processing task: " + taskId);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has finished task: " + taskId);
            });
        }

        // Step 3: Shut down the pool
        cachedThreadPool.shutdown();
    }
}
